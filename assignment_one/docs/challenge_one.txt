### Challenge 1: Building voice agents with LiveKit

We use [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/) at Riverline to build AI voice agents. LiveKit is an open-source tool that helps connect large language models (LLMs), text-to-speech (TTS), and speech-to-text (STT) services. It also works with cloud telephony systems so that the AI can make and receive phone calls.

Your task is to build a **debt collection voice agent** using LiveKit. It should be able to call people (outbound calls) and talk to them like a real human.

You can design your own debt collection scenario (e.g., a bank reminding about overdue credit card bills, a telecom company following up on unpaid dues, etc.). Here are the requirements:

1. **Robust Voice Agent**
    - Your bot should handle edge cases (unexpected user responses, background noise, interruptions, etc.).
2. **Human-like Conversation**
    - Make the conversation feel natural and polite.
    - The voice should sound real and convincing. So, choose your models wisely.
3. **Phone Call Integration**
    - Use Twilio to dial outbound phone calls to any number. Their free credits should be able to cover and set up instructions will be available on their docs as well as LiveKit docs.
    - Tip: Use a **US number**. Indian numbers require business verification.
4. **Easy to Use**
    - Make the app simple and smooth to use.
5. **Bonus (Brownie Points)**
    - Record the call using egress functionality and save the transcript of the conversation using LiveKit.
    - Use any opensource framework to analyze the transcript to predict the customerâ€™s risk. (This part is meant to be open-ended. Novelty is welcomed :) )

Submit a code implementation of the application, along with a 2-3 minute Loom recording of you walking through the project.
